# CLIP Abstraction for Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer

## Overview
The **Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer** project aims to synthesize images that balance semantic adherence to textual prompts with accurate integration of visual styles extracted from an input image. Traditional models like Stable Diffusion and CLIP excel individually but often struggle to maintain this balance. To address this, our approach integrates the Kandinsky model and utilizes structured task decomposition with an LLM agent for precise appearance transfer.

## Features
### 1. Appearance Transfer via CLIP Abstraction
- Utilize CLIPâ€™s latent space to align text and image embeddings.
- Perform arithmetic operations on embeddings for nuanced style transfer.
- Implement structured task decomposition using LLM-generated JSON outputs.

### 2. Model Integration
- Integrate models such as:
  - **Kandinsky Models** (for texture and style preservation)
  - **Stable Diffusion XL** (for base image generation)
  - **CLIP** (for semantic alignment)
- Utilize LLM frameworks:
  - **GPT-4O** (for enhanced task decomposition)
  - **LangChain** (for model interaction and decision-making)

### 3. Pipeline Architecture & Decision Making
- Implement structured prompt design to ensure accurate decomposition of user requests.
- Employ embedding arithmetic for controlled pattern extraction and integration.
- Replace IP-Adapter with Kandinsky for improved style-content alignment.
- Utilize a secure web app hosted on AWS EC2 for efficient API communication.

### 4. Evaluation & Refinement
- Measure performance using **CLIP similarity scores**.
- Conduct manual qualitative evaluation based on semantic accuracy, style fidelity, and visual quality.
- Iterate on pipeline improvements based on experimental findings.
